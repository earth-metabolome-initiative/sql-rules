# SQL Constraints

[SQL-traits](https://github.com/earth-metabolome-initiative/sql-traits)-based higher-level rules. These are general-purpose constraints that are often desirable in SQL projects, as they enforce common-sense rules about the schemas which are not enforced by the database itself.

If you can think about any rule that most SQL databases should enforce but do not, please consider contributing it here!
